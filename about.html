    <p>
     With minimal CS exposure growing up, I rarely had the opportunities to learn about CS and the potential career paths associated with the field. However, since moving to San Francisco and becoming so immersed in a vibrant tech ecosystem, I truly have witnessed the limitless potential when it comes to technology and how the current skills I possess could translate directly to the field of programming. And while I have thoroughly enjoyed my career in business development, I've decided to fully pursue a pivot into programming where I will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge solutions, collaborate with incredibly talented individuals, and hopefully contribute to products that one day have a global impact! As I begin my journey at Rithm School, I look forward to face the challenges ahead as I continue to immerse myself in the world of programming. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity to work with everyone in the Rithm 37 cohort and cannot wait to see the feats that we accomplish together!
